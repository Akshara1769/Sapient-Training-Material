Step 1: Design the Job Application Form

Define the fields for the job application form: First Name, Last Name, Email ID, Phone Number, College Name, Total Marks on Degree, and Skills.

Step 2: Create a JobApplication Class

Create a Java class named JobApplication.
Define instance variables for each field in the job application form (e.g., firstName, lastName, email, phoneNumber, collegeName, totalMarks, skills).
Create a constructor to initialize these variables.
Create getter and setter methods for each variable to access and modify the data.

Step 3: Input Data from User

Use the Scanner class to read input from the user.
Prompt the user to enter values for each field in the job application form.
Create an instance of the JobApplication class and set the values using setter methods.

Step 4: Exception Handling

Implement exception handling to handle potential errors during input. For example, handle NumberFormatException when parsing the total marks.
